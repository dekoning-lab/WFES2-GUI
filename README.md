# WFES-GUI

This repository is an implementation of a GUI for [wfes2](https://github.com/dekoning-lab/wfes2).

Wright-Fisher Exact Solver (`WFES`) implements a variety of exact calculations with the Wright-Fisher model. Unlike other approaches, `WFES` does not use simulations or strong simplifying assumptions. `WFES` benefits from high-performance linear algebra techniques, making it possible to compute exact quantities for biologically realistic population sizes. The following document details the usage of the `WFES` code.

## Upcoming features

* Graphical User Interface for all functions of wfes2.
* [ViennaCL](https://github.com/viennacl/viennacl-dev) integration for execution on GPUs.
* Configuration files.
* Windows, Linux and Mac support.

## Installation

In development.
